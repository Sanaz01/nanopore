FY_d1 - simple modified basecalling to detect methylation marks using multiple softwares
EB_EL_d1 - same as above + barcoding

EB and FY are uncomplicated malaria samples.
EL is celebral malaria sample.
d denotes DNA.

We need to check if at all there is methylation in parasite DNA. 
Now that we have a clue for it, we need to check the credibility of it on the basis of
different tools to verify if the methylation is occurring on the same coordinate on the genome.
